# Group project

**This document is a DRAFT and the information contained herein is subject to change as the details are being finalized.**

The objective of project work is to apply the knowledge gained in the course to an open research problem.  Students are expected to work in groups of 2-3 and work on a project of their choosing from the list of available projects.

You'll need to sign up by filling out **this form** (*link to be added*) by 19 October at the latest. People failing to sign up will automatically receive 0 points on their project work.

On the sign up form, you'll need to specify a first and a second project preference. We'll do our best to grant you your first preference and the best way for you to make sure it happens is to form a team with 1 or 2 additional students. Otherwise, we'll need to team you up with others.


## Projects

You may choose one from the following projects:

  * MS Marco Document re-ranking
    - Given a candidate top-100 document as retrieved by BM25, re-rank documents by relevance.
    - https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/
  * TREC 2019 Conversational Assistance
    - Given a series of conversational utterances, identify relevant passages for each user utterance that satisfies the user's information need.
    - http://www.treccast.ai/
  * Semantic Answer Type Prediction
    - Given a question in natural language, the task is to predict type of the answer using a set of candidates from a target ontology (DBpedia).

## Objectives

The overall objective of the group project is to develop and experimentally compare approaches for a given information retrieval problem. Specifically, you'll first need to establish a reasonable baseline, then develop one or multiple advanced methods aiming to improve over the baseline. Using a standard test collection, you'll need to experimentally compare the baseline and advanced solutions.


## Workflow and rules

  * You'll need to hand in a report using the specified project template. The page limit for the report is 4 A4 pages (in double column format).
  * You'll also need to submit your code and the generated output files so that we can verify your solution and results.
  * There are no restrictions on the programming language, toolkits/libraries used, etc. with the default choice being Python and the packages used in the exercises/assignments.
  * Some of the problems involve working with large datasets. If you need server access, you'll need to contact the Unix system administrator.
  * While you are expected to work individually, you'll have the possibility to get feedback on your ideas in a regular weekly basis. For each group, there will be a weekly dedicated 15mins slot to discuss the project with the lecturer. Also, there will be an internal intermediate deadline for getting feedback on the draft of your report.

## Timeline

While the following is merely a recommendation, it may help you to stay on course.

  * Week 1:
    - Understand the problem
    - Preprocess and index the document collection
    - Implement a baseline method
  * Week 2
    - Run and evaluate the baseline method
    - Implement an advanced method
    - Write up your progress so far and submit the report for feedback    
  * Week 3
    - Run and evaluate your advanced method
    - Experiment with additional methods or refinements of your advanced method
    - Finalize your report


## Evaluation

Projects will be graded on the following criteria:

| Criteria | Points |
| -- | -- |
| Problem understanding | *TBD* |
| Baseline method | *TBD* |
| Advanced method(s) | *TBD* |
| Report | *TBD* |
| Code quality | *TBD* |
| **Total** | **50** |

*More details on each of the above criteria will follow.*
