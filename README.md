# Information Retrieval and Text Mining course (DAT640), University of Stavanger, fall 2020

## Updates

  * **Sep 30** Assigment 3 has been announced. The Jupyter notebook you need to complete can be found in your personal GitHub repository. This assignment is worth 10 points. The deadline is Oct 13, 16:00.
  * **Sep 24** General information on assignment grading and delivery has been posted [here](assignments/).
  * **Sep 22** Assignment 2 has been announced. The Jupyter notebook you need to complete can be found in your personal GitHub repository. This assignment is worth 10 points. The deadline is Oct 6, 16:00.
  * **Sep 21** You may use the [Issues tab](../../issues/) for posting questions. That way other could also benefit from a clarification. That way other could also benefit from a clarification (and you can also help your fellow students). For example, multiple people raised the issue of "infected" files for A1.3, which has now been clarified [there](../../issues/1).
  * **Sep 21** New format for the next 4 weeks! As of this week, Mondays will be lectures exclusively (lecture videos will follow). The exercises will be posted and done on Tuesdays. People can join in person in the lecture room or work on them remotely and ask for help on the [dedicated slack channel](https://uis-iai.slack.com/archives/C01AW7CA38E). (Note: this slack channel is reserved for this time-slot, i.e., Tuesdays between 14.15 and 16.00).
  * **Sep 21** Results for assignments A1.1 and A1.2 have been posted on Canvas. If you have any questions, you can ask them during the Wednesday labs or send an email to dat640help@gmail.com.

## Course format

**DISCLAIMER: Everything is subject to change.**

The course follows a hybrid format, where lecture videos are provided online and classroom time is used for discussion, [exercises](exercises/), and working on [assignments](assignments/).

This course involves **self-study** (which can be completed online): You're expected to watch the lecture videos, read the corresponding book chapters/sections listed on the last slide of each lecture deck, as well as complete the exercises on GitHub.

There is also a **physical component** which is not obligatory, but highly recommended for an optimal learning experience. This involves discussion and exercises in a regular classroom setting.

There is a double lecture on Mondays, 14:15-16:00 (without dividing into A/B groups). The Tuesday 14:15-16:00 slot is kept for open office hours (in KE E-433). Note that open office hours are meant for questions regarding the lecture material and/or exercises. Issues related to the assignments should be addressed at lab sessions on Wednesdays.

The semester is divided into lecture and group project work periods, with an (optional) trial exam in between.

### Lecture period (weeks 35-42)

  * Mondays and Tuesdays are classes for discussion and exercises, led by Krisztian Balog (KB).
    - The respective video lectures are made available either before or after the class (depending on the topic). If the video is made available before the class, you are expected to watch it, in order to be able to meaningfully participate in the discussion and undertake the exercises.
  * Wednesdays are labs for getting help on the obligatory [assignments](assignments/), led by Trond Linjordet (TL).
    - Assignments are to be solved individually. They constitute 50% the project work.

### Trial exam (week 43)

A trial exam will be made available mirroring the same setup that will be used at the final exam. The exam will not be corrected, but the answer key will be shared.

### Group project work (weeks 44-46)

Students will need to complete a project in groups of 2-3, and write a report that will be graded.

There will be a pool of options to select a project from. During the project period, each group can request a 15mins dedicated weekly discussion slot with the lecturer during the class hours (Mon/Tue), and can get feedback on the draft report from the teaching assistant during lab hours (Wed). Both in-person and remote (Zoom) options will be available.
