# Assignment 4 Errata

  * Under ‘Advanced entity retrieval: PRMS’, under ‘Retrieval method’, the Dirichlet smoothing specifies that ’$\mu_i$ is the field-specific smoothing parameter (set to 1000)’. However, the corresponding global variable is set in the code cell below as MU = 100. In the context of A4, the coded value of 100 is correct, and the description’s mention of ‘set to 1000’ can be ignored.
  * There is an error in the field mapping probabilities test. This part of the exercise will be corrected manually.
  * Getting less than 2500 items indexed will not be penalized.
