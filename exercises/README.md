# In-class Exercises

Exercises are provided as Jupyter notebooks.

It is strongly recommended to have Python 3.6+ installed from an [Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads).

Additionally, you need to install the `ipython-ipytest` package (it adds magic commands that make it easier to define tests directly inside a notebook using the standard `pytest` framework).  You can install it either using [conda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/ipytest) or using pip: `pip install ipytest`.


## Workflow

  * First time only: Clone this repository to your computer.
    - Simply clone the original one, there is no need to fork it (unless you're a git guru and doing it on purpose).
  * Pull changes from this repository
  * Open the respective exercises using Jupyter notebook
    - Easiest is to navigate to the `[GIT_REPO_ROOT]/exercises` folder and issue `jupyter notebook` in a terminal/command line window.
  * Complete the exercises by making the tests pass. Do NOT commit/push changes, as you won't be able to submit them.
